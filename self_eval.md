# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

Making sure I was putting curly braces and square brackets where they needed to go. Esepcially when it came to making an array of hashes.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I first started taking notes on the lessons right away. I found I wasn't really taking much in and just ended up writing every single thing down. So I changed to reading through the entire lesson first, doing the practices, and then taking notes of what I remember. I review the lesson again to add any key points to my notes.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I try to solve it on my own first. Sometimes I'll copy and paste on to an IDE so I can more quickly play around with ideas. I'll try on my own, then go through notes to see if there are any bits from the beginning that I can implement, finally I google something if I can not figure it out
